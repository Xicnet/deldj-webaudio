# Intro

This is a web implementation of DelDJ, a samples controller for live music composing.

The audio layer is currently being handled by https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato

The UI is based on Snap.svg

This is currently done without any framework, but might change in the future.

# History

This tool or instrument was born while experimenting with gamepads to play some FX on a music project I was part of around 2016.

The next step was adding samples, which where parts of songs, to compose live which parts or instruments should sound.

Special thanks to Didi and D.O.C. who were the first to export samples for DelDJ straight from the multitrack environment they use to produce their great tracks!
